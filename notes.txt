1. User logs in
    If username is already in use, prompt user to create a new one
    If username is unique, take them to the create a new channel page
        Add name to username array
2. User creates a new channel if one doesn't already exist
    Add channel name to channel list
    go to channel



    How to store all these data
    Array for username and channel list
    user_names = {
        "user_name": ["user_name":"user_name", "first_name":"John", "last_name":"Doe]
    }


    channels = []


    How to store all the messages
    Need: username, date, and message

    channel_msgs = {
        'channel_name': {"username": "blah", "date":"blah", "message":"blah"},{"username": "blah", "date":"blah", "message":"blah"},


    }
add to channel_msgs
    channel_msgs[channel_name]=[]
add to channel_name
    user_message = {"username": "session.getuser", date="datetime", "message":.....get("message)}
    channel_msgs['channel_msgs].append


JAVASCRIPT

1. When channel is opened, set channel name to localStorage
2. When message is submitted, send localStorage for channel name
3. When message is received, only if session[channel_name] matches localStorage, then emit the message
4. In JS, only append in data from Flask mactches localStorage.
